# KeePI

KeePi is a project developed in the context of the Mobile Communication Systems course of [Department of Informatics Engeneering](http://www.uc.pt/fctuc/dei/)  at University of Coimbra. It intents to explore technologies concerned to the subject Internet of Things (IoT), as well as the use of Rasperry Pi for such tasks. We’ve designed KeePi, a system which will monitor a sensitive division of a house, coupled to this system we’ve also developed a central control interface for user friendly use. This is a web application that will we be accessible to the owner from anywhere, anytime. A Raspberry Pi (detector) will use motion detection techniques (via a passive infrared sensor - PIR) and send video recording/streaming and snapshots triggers to an additional Raspberry Pi, containing a camera module. The owner will then receive notifications on his smartphone containing all the details of the trespassing, including the intruder’s snapshot.
